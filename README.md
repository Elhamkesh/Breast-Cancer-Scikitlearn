# Breast Cancer Scikit Learn

Simple tutorial on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. 
The goal is to get basic understanding of various techniques.

## Description

I use the "Wisconsin Breast Cancer" which is a default, preprocessed and cleaned datasets come with scikit-learn. The target is to classify the tumor as 'malignant' or 'benign' and code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook (CancerML.ipynb)

Techniques:
* KNN
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forests
* Neural Network
* and SVM
